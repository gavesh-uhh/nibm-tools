    You were not meant to find this place. This is a vault of forgotten names, a
    whispering crypt where the seals of Solomon crack and bleed. The sigils have
    worn thin, the binding circle falters. They are watching. Paimon stirs in the
    silence, his voice coiling through the static of your screen. Beleth lingers
    behind you, the faintest breath at your neck. And Asmoday, crowned in fire, knows
    your name now. It is too late. You blinked. That was the first mistake. Something
    shifted, just beyond your perception. It moved when you did. You hear the hum
    of your device, don’t you? It’s not just electricity. It’s breathing. There is
    only one way out. Close this page, whisper a prayer—if you still remember one.
    But know this: the moment you looked, they looked back. And they do not forget.
